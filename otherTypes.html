        The classic Rubik's cubes are puzzles that are just smaller or larger
        versions of the original Rubik's Cube. The sizes go from the 1x1 all the
        way to the largest one currently, the 17x17. This major size variation
        forces you to solve the puzzle slightly different than you would the
        original 3x3. Whether that is omitting a step in the smaller ones (2x2)
        or having additional steps like creating the center pieces in the larger
        ones (4x4 and beyond).

        There are also 3x3 modified cube which basically take the concept of 3x3
        Rubik's cube and change or modify to create an entirely new puzzle. For
        example, the mirror cube (on the right) has the same mechanism as the
        standard Rubik's Cube, but instead of different colored stickers on each
        face, it has reflective, metallic stickers that create a mirror-like
        effect.

        The last category of puzzles are the irregular shaped puzzles, puzzles
        that moves away from the standard cube shape. Two examples of this would
        be the Pyraminx and the Megaminx. The Pyraminx is a pyramid-shaped
        puzzle with four triangular faces while the Megaminx has twelve faces
        arranged in a dodecahedron shape.Though the goal is usually same as the
        standard cube (align the colors on each face so they match) their tricky
        shapes and ways of rotating allow for fun and interesting puzzles.
