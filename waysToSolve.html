        The beginner method for solving a Rubik's cube is a straightforward and
        accessible technique that is ideal for those who are just starting to
        learn how to solve the puzzle. This method typically involves solving
        one layer of the cube at a time, starting with the bottom layer and
        moving upwards. The first step involves solving the bottom layer by
        creating a cross, followed by completing the first layer corners. Then,
        the middle layer is solved by moving the pieces from the top layer to
        their respective positions in the middle layer. Finally, the top layer
        is solved by orienting the last layer and shifting its pieces to create
        a complete solved cube. With practice, this method can be mastered
        quickly, and it provides a solid foundation for exploring more advanced
        solving techniques.

        The CFOP method, also known as the Fridrich method, is an advanced
        technique for solving a Rubik's cube that is widely used by speedcubers.
        The method is based on four main steps: cross, F2L (first two layers),
        OLL (orientation of the last layer), and PLL (permutation of the last
        layer). The first step involves solving the cross on the bottom layer
        while simultaneously inserting the first layer corners. The second step
        involves solving the remaining corners and edges of the first two
        layers. The third step involves orienting the last layer in one of 57
        possible cases. The final step involves permuting the last layer pieces
        to solve the cube. While the CFOP method may seem complex, it allows for
        faster solving times by reducing the number of moves required to solve
        the cube and allowing for more efficient algorithms. However, mastering
        the method requires a lot of practice and memorization of algorithms.
        This method is the most popular method for speed solving

        The Roux method is an another technique for solving a Rubik's cube that
        is identified by its fewer moves than other methods. The method is based
        on two main steps: block building and solving the rest of the cube. The
        first step involves creating two 1x2x3 blocks on opposite sides of the
        cube, one on the left and one on the right. These blocks are then
        combined to form a 2x2x3 block in the middle layer. The second step
        involves solving the remaining pieces of the cube by manipulating the
        2x2x3 block. This approach allows for more intuitive solving and fewer
        algorithms to be memorized, making it an attractive method for many
        speedcubers. However, it requires a lot of practice and spatial
        reasoning skills to master, and its efficiency is dependent on the
        solver's ability to recognize and create efficient block-building
        techniques.

        The ZZ method for solving the Rubik's Cube consists of three main steps:
        EO, F2L, and EPLL. The first step is EO (Edge-Orientation), the goal is
        to orient all of the edges on the cube so that they are either in their
        correct position or one move away from. Next, F2L is used to solve the
        first two layers of the cube by pairing up corner and edge pieces and
        inserting them into their correct position in one step. Finally, EPLL
        (Edge Permutation and Last Layer) is used to solve the last layer of the
        cube by shifting the edges into their correct position, followed by
        orienting the corners. The ZZ method is least popoular method out of
        these four.
