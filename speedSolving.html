          Speedsolving the Rubik's Cube 3x3 is all about solving the cube as
          quickly as possible. People who enjoy it learn different ways to solve
          the cube quickly and practice often to get faster. They use a method
          called CFOP, which involves solving the cube layer by layer, and they
          memorize different sets of moves to do it faster. To get better, they
          also improve their finger movements and sometimes use special cubes
          that turn more easily. Speedcubers compete against each other to see
          who can solve the cube the fastest, the video on the left is current
          fastest solve of 3.47s!

          Another popular category is the One-Handed Cube, where competitors use
          only one hand to solve the 3x3 Cube. There is also a Blindfolded
          category, where competitors solve the cube without looking at it,
          using only memorization and visualization. Additionally, there are
          categories for solving larger cubes, such as the 4x4, 5x5, and 6x6
          Cubes, which require different techniques and strategies to solve.
          Other categories include solving multiple cubes at once, solving a
          cube with one's feet, and solving cubes in unusual shapes and
          configurations. Each category has its own set of rules and challenges,
          and competitors are often required to follow strict guidelines and
          time limits to compete fairly.
