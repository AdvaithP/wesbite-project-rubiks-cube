          Hi there! My name is Advaith, and I am currently in 9th grade. 
          One of my favorite hobbies is solving Rubik's cubes, and I've been 
          doing it since 2nd grade. It all started when my uncle introduced me 
          to the puzzle during a visit to him in Australia, and I've been hooked ever since. 
          I've been practicing and improving my skills over the years, and my fastest solve is 
          currently 31.56 seconds. Solving Rubik's cubes is not only a fun pastime for me, 
          but it also helps me improve my problem-solving skills and focus.
