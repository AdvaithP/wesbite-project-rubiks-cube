          The Rubik's Cube, also known as the Magic Cube, is a three-dimensional
          mechanical puzzle that has captivated minds around the world since its
          invention in 1974 by Ernő Rubik, a Hungarian architect and professor
          of architecture. Originally called the "Magic Cube," Rubik created the
          puzzle as a teaching tool to help his students understand
          three-dimensional geometry. However, it quickly gained popularity
          beyond the classroom, and by 1980 it was licensed by the Rubik's
          company and marketed as a toy puzzle.

          The Rubik's Cube gained global recognition as a challenging brain
          teaser, sparking a worldwide craze in the 1980s. One significant event
          in the history of the Rubik's Cube is the Rubik's Cube World
          Championship, held in Budapest, Hungary, which holds special
          significance as the birthplace of the puzzle. The first official
          Rubik's Cube World Championship took place in Budapest in 1982,
          attracting competitors from around the globe who showcased their
          speed-solving skills. Since then, Budapest has remained a prominent
          location for Rubik's Cube competitions, hosting numerous championships
          and other events related to the popular puzzle.
